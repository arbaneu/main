Overview
~~~~~~~~
Preprocessing and analysis of PET data are done on the MGH cluster as well as on ``Aether``, a shared Windows workstation at the Hooker group. If you don't have access to ``Aether`` yet, ask Baileigh Hightower if she can grant you one. She would need your MGH ID.

Once ``Aether`` access is granted, the machine can be accessed through *Microsoft Remote Desktop*. Click on the icon '+' to add a new Desktop instance. Enter ``170.20.77.30`` in the PC Name field and use your MGH credentials (e.g., ``Partners/yk879``) to log in.
