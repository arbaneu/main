Read the Docs
=============

This documentation is hosted on `Readthedocs.org <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and is continuously updated based on changes made to ARBA's `GitHub page <https://github.com/arbaneu/main>`_.

To link a Readthedocs page and a GitHub page, one would need to set up a webhook. Detailed instructions can be found on this `page <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/webhooks.html#webhook-creation>`_.

This documentation is written for the most part in ``reStructuredText``. Below are some helpful resources for using this language:

- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html
- https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst

I highly recommend using `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ and the associated packages for contributing to this documentation using ``reStructuredText``.
